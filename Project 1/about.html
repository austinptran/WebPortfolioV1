              Howdy! My name is Austin Tran and I am the loudest and the proudest member of the Fightin' Texas
              Aggie Class of 2022! I am studying <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/electrical-computer/computer-engineering-bs-electrical-engineering-track/"
              style="color:blue" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> to obtain a Bachelor of Science with a
              minor in Mathematics. I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina but moved to Houston, Texas in 2011. After graduating,
              I am looking forward to pursuing a career in software engineering and computer architecture.

          <p>I was highly involved with First Tech Challenge Robotics from 2016-2018 and have participated in both local and state competitions. <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc" style="color:blue" target="_blank">FIRST Tech Challenge</a> Robotics is a program where students team up to design, build, program, and operate
            robots that complete objectives for the most points. These objectives would be carrying out tasks like launching cubes and balls into a hoop, placing a large exercise ball into a ring 4 feet up in the
            air, or climbing an increasingly slanted wall. To promote critical thinking skills, the robot's dimensions were to be limited in an 18 in x 18 in x 18 in box, but it was able to exceed these dimensions once
            the round starts.

          <p>I am interested in developing and improving my technical skills, such as furthering my knowledge in computer architecture and software engineering, as well as learning more about AI. In fact, during the Fall 2020 semester, I was involved in <a href="https://ai-4-all.org/" style="color:blue" target="_blank">AI4ALL</a>, which was
            a program designed to educate about AI and its impacts, problem-solving capabilities, and even present and potential dangers when integrated into society. Not only did I learn about AI, but I was also given a couple opportunities to experiment with machine learning, such as having a camera detect whether the target is a male or female,
            whether they're smiling or frowning, or even if they're throwing up rock, paper, or scissors.
